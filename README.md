Lists and File I/O
==============
# Fork the repository

Before you do anything else, make a fork of this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.  You will need to be logged in to a GitHub account (feel free to use either pair's account).  Once you've made your fork, scroll back down and you should be able to continue reading this text where you left off.

# Lists exercises

Now that you have your own fork, look at the top of this page.  You should see all the files in this repository.  Find the one called `list-exercises.md` and open it.  Follow the instructions there.  When you are done, return to this page (you can do that by clicking the name of the repository at the top of the page from anywhere in the repository).

# Make a local clone

Now, clone your fork (note: make sure not to clone the original, but your own fork!) to your local machine.

As you work through the exercises, each time you complete an exercise or function, make a commit.  Use the `--author` flag or edit the `~/.gitconfig` file to have your name and email so that the commits show up under the right name!  Run `git log` after your first commit to make sure it's under the right name.  You can also run the two `git config` commands as described here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#Your-Identity

# File I/O exercises

We'll do these after the file I/O lecture!
